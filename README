Kestrel client for AMPL modeling environment

A complete user's guide to Kestrel is available at http://neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/kestrel.html



INSTALLATION
------------
A working AMPL executable is required for using the Kestrel client.  For more information on AMPL, see http://ampl.com.  A demo version (limited to 300 variables and 300 constraints) is available for download from their website.


Windows:
  Download kestrel.zip from http://neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/downloads.html
  Unzip kestrel.zip into same directory as AMPL executable.  This directory should now have the following files, in addition to ampl.exe and other AMPL files:
    - README
    - kestrel.exe
    - w9xpopen.exe
    - kestrelkill
    - kestrelret
    - kestrelsub
    - MSVCR71.dll	
    - library.zip

  Important - Do not unzip the library.zip file, it needs to remain as it is.

Unix: (requires python to be installed)
  Download kestrel.tar.gz from http://neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/downloads.html
  Unzip kestrel.tar.gz into a directory in the path (we recommend the same directory as the ampl binary)


USAGE
-----
Design your model as you normally would.  When choosing options, everything
should remain as usual with the following exceptions:

 - Choose 
      ampl: option solver kestrel;
   instead of usual solver name.

 - Choose the solver you wish to use with 
      ampl: option kestrel_options "solver=<solver_name>";
           (Do not actually type in '<' or '>')

   If you do not know what solvers are available via Kestrel, submitting a job
   (see below) without setting kestrel_options will return a list of 
   possible solvers.

 - When kestrel_options is set, submit the job to NEOS by typing 
      ampl: solve;

 - If you are somehow disconnected from the Kestrel server during your
   job execution, the job will still be running on a remote machine.
   To retrieve the results in this case:
      ampl: option kestrel_options "job=<job#> password=<password>";
      ampl: solve;
   Jobs may removed from the NEOS server after some length of time 
   (no sooner than two days), so you may not be able to retrieve your
   job this way after that time.  To resume normal Kestrel solver operations
   type:
      ampl: option kestrel_options "solver=<solver_name>";
